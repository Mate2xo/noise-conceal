# Language syntax "noise" conceal in Vim

This fork extends [Alok's work](https://alok.github.io/2018/04/26/using-vim-s-conceal-to-make-languages-more-tolerable/) for Ruby. Most keywords/operators are replaced by logical symbols to make reading code easier and faster.

Install with your favorite plugin manager, e.g. `Plug 'mate2xo/noise-conceal'` for VimPlug or `call minpac#add('mate2xo/noise-conceal')` for minpac
